# Pomodoro Technique GUI App
This GUI application implements the Pomodoro technique, a time management method aimed at boosting productivity. By default, the timer is set to 50 minutes, as I  believe that such a duration is adequate in order to achieving a state of "deep work."

The app encourages focused work by deviating from the common practice of short study periods and frequent breaks, which can lead to distractions. Through personal experience, I've found this approach effective.
In addition to the timer, the app offers a selection of nature sounds, lofi, and jazz playlists, limited to 6 options. These ambient sounds can enhance concentration and create a conducive environment for studying or working.

Additionally, the app includes a checkmark feature that tracks completed sessions, providing users with a sense of accomplishment and motivation to continue their tasks.
Please note that while the app isn't flawless, any suggestions for improvement are welcome. If you encounter any issues, consider removing music-related functions and buttons from the code otherwise download the packaged app.

P.S: will add time selection feature soon.
