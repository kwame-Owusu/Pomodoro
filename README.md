# Pomodoro
It is a GUI App that uses the pomodoro technique to help study or read, I have set the default time to 50 mins, because I think to get "deep work" done you need approximately that amount of time.
studying for 25 mins and a taking a lot  of breaks can become quite distracting, After using this app myself I think it is worth using; because there is also white noise,lofi and jazz selections from the app(limited to 6 playlists).
There is also a checkmark that will tell the user how many sessions they have done, which might encourage them to keep on studying or working on whatever they are doing.

p.s :
I know it is not perfect,if you see something that you think I can improve on, please don't hesitate to tell me.
if the  code does not work, delete functions related to music and all its buttons.
